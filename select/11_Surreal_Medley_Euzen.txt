Ride the wind in time
Where no wind blows
And no sound grows
And rally to the unknown where real
Real occurs like fish in furs and
Who can fly to beat the time
And chase the light
And face the never ending night
My spaceships fit for fight
We'll take the fight, confound

Surreal medley
Take it two steps left and one step right
And are we there yet, I need to know
Need it badly, adequately

To reach me and greet me
I'll go where you could meet me
I'll go wherever you say
And do this mission discretely

To reach me and greet me
I'll go where you could meet me
I'll go wherever you say
And do this mission discretely

On our way
Time to stray
Time to soar where darkness shine

On our way
Time to stray
Time to soar where darkness shine
Time to scorch this place of mine
Time to flee through space and time

Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time
